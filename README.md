If you are in the healthcare industry, you may be fielding lots of extra patient inquiries due to the COVID-19. One way to reduce the
amount of chats your agents receive and more quickly qualify and assist your patients is to use a bot. We’ve created a COVID-19 Symptom 
Checker bot specifically for this scenario, using the Chat Bot API. We are developing an all in one web based application that allows
user to check whether a person is suffering from COVID-19 or not. By using a chat bot that interact with users and ask some predefined 
question regarding to their health , previous travel history and some other questions to diagnose COVID-19 and at the end tells the 
probability of having COVID-19.The most important factor in preventing the spread of Virus locally is to power the citizens with the 
right information and taking precautions .Our application will provide all these relevant information to the user.
In addition to this, it’ll provides other features like:

1.Case Tracker : User can check the latest updates of WHO regarding to this pandemic.

2.WHO Updates : Latest news on coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

3.Queries Resolver : Queries related to COVID-19 .

4.Indian State/UTs Helpline No.: All states/UTs helpline numbers are available here for the user's convenience.

5.Myth busters : It will provide Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related all the advice to the public .

6.Hospitals Near Me : It tell the nearest hospitals from the user. Also if after using the chatbot application,if the users find his/her case is at risk level or requires doctor advice so the user can use this feature .
